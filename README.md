# Game Scripts Library

A personal collection of reusable scripts I use frequently in my game development projects. These scripts are written to speed up development, reduce repetition, and stay organized across multiple games.

## 📦 What's inside?

This repository may include scripts for:

- Player movement
- Collectible items
- UI management
- Game state handling
- Sound and audio triggers
- Enemy AI basics
- Input handling
- Utility functions

## 🎮 Technologies

- Unity (C#)
- JavaScript (for web-based games)
- Godot (GDScript)

## 🛠️ How to use

- Simply copy the scripts you need into your project.
- Make sure to adjust namespaces or references depending on your setup.
- All scripts are written to be modular and easy to integrate.

## 🧠 Why this repo?

Instead of rewriting the same code over and over, I keep my most useful scripts here — clean, tested, and ready to plug into new prototypes or full games.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an evolving library. Some scripts may be basic or unfinished — feel free to improve them or adapt them to your needs.
